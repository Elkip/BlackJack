# BlackJack
A simple blackjack emulator demonstrating how objects work in Python
I wrote this on a 3 hour plane ride, it has room for more features

# To Play
run the main file with: python ./blackjack.py

When prompted type 'Hit' Or 'Stay'
After the round ends type 'Y' to continue or 'N' to exit 

# Further Development Ideas
User creation and login system, encypting and storing credentials 
A points/cash system
Allow multiple users to play
Don't shuffle the deck after every round, create a card counting system
